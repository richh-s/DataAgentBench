A  class  of  systems \ncalled  personal  informatics  is  appearing  that  help  people \ncollect and reflect on personal information. However, there \nis no comprehensive list of problems that users experience \nusing  these  systems,  and  no  guidance  for  making  these \nsystems  more  effective.  To  address  this,  we  conducted \nsurveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect \non  personal  information.  We  derived  a  stage-based  model \nof  personal  informatics  systems  composed  of  five  stages  \n(preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) \nand  identified  barriers  in  each  of  the  stages.  These  stages \nhave  four  essential  properties:  b'}}
